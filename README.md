# Memory and surprise

This repository contains the full data and scripts to reproduce all analyses and figures used in the project testing whether the presence of surprising/not-surprising videos 

1. affects PRL performance,
2. modulates successive old/new discrimination of the individual images used in the single trials of the PRL task.

"master_file.R" sources all other scripts and implements the entire project workflow.

The "src" folder contains all relevant R and Python scripts for data processing and analysis.

The "data" folder contains all raw data for both "surprise" and "non-surprise" conditions, and for the "self" and "stranger" conditions. Each sub-folder contains data from one experimental session.
