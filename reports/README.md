From Wikipedia:

There are typically three assumptions made by computational models using the 2AFC:
i) evidence favoring each alternative is integrated over time; 
ii) the process is subject to random fluctuations; and 
iii) the decision is made when sufficient evidence has accumulated favoring one alternative over the other.
— Bogacz et al., The Physics of Optimal Decision Making

It is typically assumed that the difference in evidence favoring each alternative is the quantity tracked over time and that which ultimately informs the decision; however, evidence for different alternatives could be tracked separately.

The drift-diffusion model (DDM) is a well defined model, that is proposed to implement an optimal decision policy for 2AFC. It is the continuous analog of a random walk model.[7] The DDM assumes that in a 2AFC task, the subject is accumulating evidence for one or other of the alternatives at each time step, and integrating that evidence until a decision threshold is reached. As the sensory input which constitutes the evidence is noisy, the accumulation to the threshold is stochastic rather than deterministic – this gives rise to the directed random-walk-like behavior. The DDM has been shown to describe accuracy and reaction times in human data for 2AFC tasks.
